    "content": "With over 12 years of experience in software engineering management and technical leadership, I've been pushing the boundaries of mobile and web development. Since 2016, I've specialized in the OTT video space, working with nearly all aspects of streaming media. I developed a groundbreaking shared Swift library for iOS/tvOS apps, led the tvOS and Roku platforms at fuboTV, and served as Engineering Lead for VOD Encoding and Operations. Currently, as Engineering Lead of Video Innovations, I focus on developing server-side multi-view systems and just-in-time transcoding solutions. My leadership approach is deeply rooted in my service with the United States Marine Corps, where I served as an Infantry Squad Leader with the rank of Sergeant.
