**SUMMARY**

With a robust foundation in software engineering management and a technical leadership spanning over 12 years, I have continually pushed the boundaries of mobile and web development. My journey took a pivotal turn in 2016 when I ventured into the OTT video space, allowing me to delve into nearly all facets of streaming media.

My passion led to the development of a groundbreaking shared Swift library for iOS/tvOS apps, which innovatively separated the UI from the player, enhancing player scalability for both linear and VOD content.

As the manager for the tvOS and Roku platforms at fuboTV, I spearheaded the significant pivot towards "Connected Devices," guiding these platforms through a transformative evolution. By 2018, my role further expanded to Engineering Lead of VOD Encoding and Operations. In this capacity, I was at the forefront of bringing the VOD video encoding and packaging pipeline in-house. My achievements in this role are highlighted by my pioneering efforts to enable our VOD platform to support both HEVC and AVC formats, significantly enhancing content delivery network flexibility and efficiency. This dual-format support ensured that we could deliver the highest quality video content across a wide range of devices and network conditions, optimizing streaming capabilities and improving the end-user experience with seamless, high-definition viewing.

My responsibilities also encompassed intensive FFmpeg research, mastering ISO standards, crafting encoding workflows, optimizing AWS management, developing Docker containers, and driving software enhancements to elevate the streaming experience. These efforts collectively contributed to setting new industry standards for video quality and accessibility.

In 2022, embracing the role of Engineering Lead of Video Innovations, I focused on the forefront of server-side multi-view systems development, underscoring my commitment to the future of video streaming. The years 2023 and 2024 marked a significant advancement in my career as I led the development of a just-in-time transcoding and packaging playout solution for HEVC files. This initiative revolutionized streaming efficiency and quality, demonstrating my dedication to innovative video delivery solutions.

My foundational ethos, deeply rooted in my honorable service with the United States Marine Corps as an Infantry Squad Leader with the rank of Sergeant, has instilled in me a profound sense of duty, leadership, and commitment to excellence. This experience has been pivotal in shaping my approach to overcoming challenges and leading teams to success in the tech industry.
